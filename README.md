## Introduction
Welcome to the **Interactive Demonstration of Schedulers**! This project is designed to provide an engaging and intuitive way to learn about various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. From basic scheduling methods to advanced real-time algorithms, this tool enables you to visualize, experiment, and compare their behaviors.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations:** See how processes are scheduled in real-time.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Customize input data such as number of processes, execution times, and time quantum.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Observe and analyze the differences in performance between scheduling techniques.

## Algorithms Covered
1. **[Round Robin (RR) Scheduling](https://cs420-scheduler-demo.streamlit.app/Round_Robin_Scheduling_%F0%9F%94%84):** Time slices are shared equally among processes.
2. **[Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)](https://cs420-scheduler-demo.streamlit.app/Rate_Monotonic_Scheduling_%E2%8F%B1):** A real-time scheduling algorithm where processes with shorter periods are assigned higher priorities.
3. **[Experimental Round Robin Scheduling](https://cs420-scheduler-demo.streamlit.app/Experimental_Round_Robin_%F0%9F%94%81):** Who knows what will happen, if we add individual time quantum for each process.
