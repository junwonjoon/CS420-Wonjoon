# Welcome to This Page

## Overview
This project provides an engaging, hands-on demonstration of various CPU scheduling algorithms, crucial for operating systems. Learn how schedulers determine the order in which processes execute to maximize efficiency and fairness. 

## Topics Covered
- **[Round Robin (RR) Scheduling]({url_round_robin}):** Time slices are shared equally among processes.
- **[Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)]({url_RMS}):** A real-time scheduling algorithm where processes with shorter periods are assigned higher priorities.
- **[Experimental Round Robin Scheduling]({url_RR_experimental}):** Who knows what will happen, if we add individual time quantum for each process? 
##### To navigate please use the side bar on the *left* to view different scheduling algorithms.

## Interactive Features
- Visualize the scheduling process in real-time.
- Customize input data such as number of processes, execution times, and time quantum.
- Compare results between different scheduling algorithms.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the trade-offs and use cases for different scheduling techniques.
- Explore how schedulers impact system performance and user experience.
